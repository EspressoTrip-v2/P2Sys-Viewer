P2SYS-VIEWER VERSION 1.0.3

# MESSAGE FOR JULES

#####################

!!! Jules please click DOWNLOAD UPDATE !!!

It will download in the background and you will
get an orange button to apply the update on the
P2Sys customer number search window. Click it
when it appears.

This update is mostly for you, your PC has a tiny
screen, the app was never designed for such a low screen
resolution.

This will make it easier for you to work as things will
fit better on the screen.

Regards,
Juan
